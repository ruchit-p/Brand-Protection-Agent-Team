Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at conduct@example.com (replace before publishing). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 (`https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/`).
